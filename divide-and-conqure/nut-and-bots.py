# a set of n nuts of different sizes and n bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently. 
# Constraint: Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.
# Another way of asking this problem is, given a box with locks and keys where one lock can be opened by one key in the box. We need to match the pair.


# Python program to solve nut and bolt
# problem using Quick Sort.
from typing import List

# Method to print the array
def printArray(arr: List[str]) -> None:
	for i in range(6):
		print(" {}".format(arr[i]), end=" ")
	print()

# Similar to standard partition method.
# Here we pass the pivot element too
# instead of choosing it inside the method.
def partition(arr: List[str], low: int, high: int, pivot: str) -> int:
	i = low
	j = low
	while j < high:
		if (arr[j] < pivot):
			arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
			i += 1
		elif (arr[j] == pivot):
			arr[j], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[j]
			j -= 1
		j += 1
	arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]

	# Return the partition index of
	# an array based on the pivot
	# element of other array.
	return i

# Function which works just like quick sort
def matchPairs(nuts: List[str], bolts: List[str], low: int, high: int) -> None:
	if (low < high):

		# Choose last character of bolts
		# array for nuts partition.
		pivot = partition(nuts, low, high, bolts[high])

		# Now using the partition of nuts
		# choose that for bolts partition.
		partition(bolts, low, high, nuts[pivot])

		# Recur for [low...pivot-1] &
		# [pivot+1...high] for nuts and
		# bolts array.
		matchPairs(nuts, bolts, low, pivot - 1)
		matchPairs(nuts, bolts, pivot + 1, high)
